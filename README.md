# Apriori-Algorithm
Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It is devised to operate on a database containing a lot of transactions, for instance, items brought by customers in a store.
It is very important for effective Market Basket Analysis and it helps the customers in purchasing their items with more ease which increases the sales of the markets. It has also been used in the field of healthcare for the detection of adverse drug reactions. It produces association rules that indicates what all combinations of medications and patient characteristics lead to ADRs.

In this project i implemented apriori algorithm from scrach using java, you can find the dataset that i use in Apriori-Algorithm/Dataset/test1.txt, and the code in Apriori-Algorithm/Apriori/src/com/company/Main.java.

Enjoy ^_^
